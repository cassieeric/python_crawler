Take Me Away
I use to be myself
 And use to play around
 Sometime I don't want to think
 Maybe cause I'm afraid
 I do wanna sing my song
 No matter what you say
 With you I never think
 along~
 I lood into my soul
 One day I hope somepoeple talk to me
 About life
 But I can't take no more
 Where where where where my Shangri-la
 I do wanna sing my song
 No matter what you say
 With you I never think
 along~
 I lood into my soul
 One day I hope somepoeple talk to me
 About life
 But I can't take no more
 Where...where...where...where my Shangri-la
 Many many time I want to go
 So I hardly open my eyes
 The truth even force me run...run...run...run away...run away
 But now I'm same to you
 But I feel nothing better for sure
 The star...star...star would you take me away
Many many time I want to go
 So I hardly open my eyes
 The truth even force me run...run...run...run away...run away
 But now I'm same to you
 But I feel nothing better for sure
 The star...star...star would you take me away
Many many time I want to go
 So I hardly open my eyes
 The truth even force me run...run...run...run away...run away
 But now I'm same to you
 But I feel nothing better for sure
 The star...star...star would you take me away
