Apple
作曲 : 逃跑计划
 作词 : 逃跑计划

 In my life, Im the only one
 I never cry, But I still cant see
 Always on my way, To you
 Youre in my sky, Its true

 Yellow apple, Green apple, Red apple
 Colourful apples,
 Beautiful apple, Lovely apple, Your apple
 All my apples

 In your life, Youre the only one
 You never cry, But you still cant see
 Always on your way, Youre free
 Were by your side, If you need

 Hello uncle give me smile
 Hello brother let us play
 Let us play life like a game
 Oh mother do you have long hair
 Oh father did you suffer war
 Oh god if you loved me

 Yellow apple, Green apple, Red apple
 Colourful apples
 Beautiful apple, Lovely apple, Your apple
 Yellow apple, Green apple, Red apple
 Colourful apples
 Beautiful apple, Lovely apple, Your apple
 All my apples
